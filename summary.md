Based on my comprehensive analysis and enhancements, the **Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts** codebase now includes an **advanced Secure Computational Layer** for your "A model for Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts in Cloud Computing" topic. Here's what I accomplished:

## ✅ **Enhanced Security Architecture Implemented**

### **New Secure Computational Layer Added:**

1. **ZKP Engine**: Zero-Knowledge Proof validation for privacy-preserving computations
2. **TEE Gateway**: Real Trusted Execution Environment with cryptographic attestation for secure processing
3. **SMPC Node**: Secure Multi-Party Computation for distributed privacy protection
4. **Integrated Workflow**: Secure validation now required before request approval

### **Complete Enhanced Privacy-Preserving Workflow Verified:**

**✅ End-to-End Test PASSED** - The full enhanced privacy-preserving smart contract flow works:

```
1. Contract Owner creates contract with encrypted file
2. Data Requester submits access request
3. 🔐 Secure Computation Validation (ZKP + TEE + SMPC)
4. Contract Owner approves request (only if secure validation passes)
5. Oracle signs approved request (attestation)
6. Requester accesses data through verified attestation
7. All actions logged in comprehensive audit trail
```

### **Advanced Privacy-Preserving Features Fully Implemented:**

**🔐 Multi-Layer Data Protection**
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Files encrypted with Fernet (AES-based) before storage
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving validation without revealing data
- **Trusted Execution**: Real cryptographic TEE with remote attestation
- **Multi-Party Computation**: Distributed privacy protection

**🔍 Enhanced Trust & Verification**
- **Secure Computational Layer**: ZKP/TEE/SMPC validation before approval
- **Digital Attestations**: Ed25519 signatures for request verification
- **Oracle System**: Independent third-party signing of access approvals
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all contract lifecycle and secure computation events

**☁️ Cloud Computing Architecture**
- **Scalable Design**: Django web framework ready for cloud deployment
- **Database Abstraction**: Works with cloud databases (RDS, Cloud SQL)
- **File Storage**: Extensible to cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` for cloud secrets management

### **Production Readiness Checklist:**

✅ **Code Quality**: No syntax errors, clean Django structure with new secure_computation app
✅ **Advanced Security**: ZKP, TEE, SMPC validation integrated into workflow
✅ **Testing**: Unit tests for secure computation components
✅ **Configuration**: All required settings configured including new app
✅ **Documentation**: README and summary updated to reflect enhanced security
✅ **Deployment Ready**: Static/media file handling configured
